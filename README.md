### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2024

+ Projec title: What made USA young people happy?
+ This project is conducted by Licheng Wu

+ Project summary: This PROJECT examines the sources of happy moments for the young American cohort in the dataset. First I merged the two datasets 'cleaned_hm.csv' and 'demographic.csv' and performed an initial analysis of this original dataset to understand its basic properties. After that I perform data cleansing on this new dataset to prepare it for subsequent analysis. Then, I went through the process of selecting the hmid of the samples to be studied and then mapping it to the data in 'senselabel'. Then the word frequency statistics are performed on the words that produce happiness, and finally the wordcloud is obtained.
+ Several questions are answered including: 1. For the different categories of happy moments, which sources account for a higher percentage? 2. Are there differences between men and women? 3. For the same young people, are there differences across age groups? 4. What characterizes the sources of happy moments for young people across all ages?
